The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).



## [0.2.3] - 2025-10-25

### Added

- Add `default_task` key to config to specify the default task to run when no task name is provided.
- `--config` now supports specifying a directory to search in, not just a file path.
- Add `python-dmon` as CLI alias in addition to `dmon` for better package name consistency.


### Fixed

- Fix `--config` non-existing path



## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed

- `exec` use full path for the executable on windows when `shell=False`
- One pass searching for both `dmon.y(a)ml` and `pyproject.toml` when going up the directory tree. The previous behavior will search for `dmon.y(a)ml` first, then if not found, start over and search for `pyproject.toml`.
- Fix "AttributeError: 'DmonMeta' object has no attribute 'name'" when listing processes (should be `task` instead of `name`)



## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-09

### Added

- Support `--config` option to specify custom config file path
- Add `exec` subcommand to run task in the foreground (maybe for test or debug purpose)

### Changed

- Rename `name` key to `task` (task name) in meta files and rename any other related variables in the codebase.
